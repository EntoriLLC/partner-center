# Entori App Scripts
### As At 2021-07-01

This repository contains the Entori installer and uninstaller Powershell scripts.

The installer adds an app registration to a Microsoft Partners Azure AD in order to connect their data to [Entori](https://entori.com/).
The uninstaller removes any previously created app registration of the same version.

Additionally the installer 'No_Partner_Center' can be used by an enterprise with Azure Active Directory to connect to [Entori](https://entori.com/)

For instructions on how to use the scripts please see the guide [here](https://docs.accordo.com/en/articles/3706375-secure-application-setup-using-powershell).
